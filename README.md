# Endava FE Challenge

## Overview

This exercise will have the candidate build a site navigation driven by an AJAX request.

Here are the guidelines for this exercise, please follow closely:

* No javascript frameworks or libraries (e.g. jQuery, Angular, React).
* CSS, not pre-Compilers (LESS, SASS) or mixin libraries (Compass, Bourbon, Neat, Foundation, etc.)
* Chrome compliance is all that's required, all functions and features available in Chrome are in play.
* Code must run after the following command, please ensure your code runs as you expect it to from a fresh checkout with these commands before submission.
* Page should look good across desktop devices.

```
$ npm i && npm start
```

Nice to haves (things that we look for):

* Adherence to accessibility standards

At a high level the navigation will have two main states:

* \>= 768px: Desktop. The nav will display as a horizontal nav. Top level nav items will display sub-nav items when clicked. No hamburger will be shown.

## Version

## Files

* server.js - node.js server that will host the site and provie the api to construct the nav

## API
